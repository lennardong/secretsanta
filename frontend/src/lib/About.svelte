    What's the problem?
</b>
<p>
    Secret Santa pairings can quickly get complicated. Person A can give to B
    but not to C, D, G. Multiply this across a mob of people and... ðŸ™„ you get
    the idea.
</p>

<b>
    How does this help?
</b>
<p>
    SecretSanta is a quick way to generate gifter-giftee pairings that makes
    everyone happy. Just enter the candidates into the pool by their groupings
    and include any special exclusions. A valid output will be generated for you
    to use and share with all participants!
